# JSC370 Midterm

Files for the mid-term project in JSC370.

This project is a self-directed study about a question which I chose to investigate using publicly-available data.

The leading question which I chose to examine in my mid-term project was "*Is there a correlation between countries' happiness levels and the happiness of the music which they listen to on Spotify?*" 

I used data from the [Spotify Charts website](https://spotifycharts.com/regional/global/daily/latest) and the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/) to investigate the results of this question.
